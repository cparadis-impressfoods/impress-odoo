"While assigning a sequence number to a record, the 'no gap' sequence "
"implementation ensures that each previous sequence number has been assigned "
"already. While this sequence implementation will not skip any sequence "
"number upon assignment, there can still be gaps in the sequence if records "
"are deleted. The 'no gap' implementation is slower than the standard one."
