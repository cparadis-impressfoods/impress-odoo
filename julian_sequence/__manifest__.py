Julian Sequence for MRP
=====================

Adds a 'Julian' sequence type for sequences. This sequence type creates a number based on the current date and YYDDD format.
This serial is also unique for each product, but not between products. Product A and Product B can share the 23321 serial but the same product cannot have the same serial. Depends on the context variable julian_product_id to be set. 
The module also adds the context variable when creating a serial from the mrp.production form. 
This sequence type overrides any other behavior from ir.sequence (size, padding, next_number, etc).
